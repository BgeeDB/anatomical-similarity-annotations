Arendt and Nuebler-Jung interpreted this pattern as support for homology between arthropod and vertebrate nerve cords and indicative of a dorsoventral inversion of the body during the invertebrate-to-vertebrate transition. The proposed nerve-cord homology was strengthened by the discovery that the fly sog gene was expressed ventrally and had ventralizing activity, whereas the homologous frog chordin gene was expressed dorsally and had dorsalizing activity. In addition, sog/chordin and dpp/bmp4 antagonized one another to establish a dorsoventral axis that was reversed between flies and frogs. Additional support came from the finding that neural progenitor cells in the central nervous system (CNS) were organized in longitudinal bands each characterized by a distinctive suite of gene expression that was homologous between flies and vertebrates, and that gene expression in these bands was comparable mediolaterally in both organisms."

It is noteworthy that the latter structures require specific expression of Pax6 in the rhombic lip of the gnathostome hindbrain. Interestingly, the lamprey rhombic lip does not express Pax6. Thus, it is tempting to speculate that in vertebrate evolution the rostral hindbrain is incapable of differentiating into the cerebellum before the co-option of Pax6 in that region. In other words, cerebellum has been brought about as an evolutionary innovation in gnathostomes, based on exaptation of MHB, rhombic lip, and some regulatory gene expression already present in the vertebrate common ancestor."

These properties are shared by ventilatory motor patterns of lower vertebrates, leading to the hypothesis that hiccough is the resurgence of archaic motor patterns and particularly of the motor pattern of gill ventilation in bimodal breathers such as most frogs, at the tadpole stage. A circuit that can generate hiccoughs may persist in mammals because it has permitted the development of pattern generators for other useful functions such as modern eupnea or suckling.

Based on our analysis, we conclude that tardigrades have lost a large intermediate region of the body axis-a region corresponding to the entire thorax and most of the abdomen of insects-and that they have lost the Hox genes that originally specified this region. Our data suggest that nearly the entire tardigrade body axis is homologous to just the head region of arthropods. Based on our results, we reconstruct a last common ancestor of Panarthropoda that had a relatively elongate body plan like most arthropods and onychophorans, rather than a compact, tardigrade-like body plan. These results demonstrate that the body plan of an animal phylum can originate by the loss of a large part of the body.

It is possible that the bending is also influenced by the spiral orientation of the cardiac myofibers.

D. unpublished observations). In diagrams made from sectioned juveniles, researchers have described the formation of two distinct hollow tubes that fuse into a single tube [25]. An invagination along the dorsal surface of this tube gives rise to the myocardium while the outer surface differentiates as pericardium. Further studies are required to confirm these classic observations of post-larval cardiogenesis. If these observations prove accurate, they indicate that Ciona heart morphogenesis may exhibit some ancestral chordate characteristics. In Xenopus and the basal chordate amphioxus, the myocardium is also derived from a dorsal invagination [26, 27].

In invertebrates, the spaces are lined only by matrix. Vertebrates have evolved a secondary cell lining, termed endothelium. (...)The last common ancestor of vertebrates and annelids, or of vertebrates and mollusks was the ancestor of the protostome-deuterostome ancestor, which lived between 600 and 700 million years ago [59]. Although the fossil record is scarce, it is widely believed that this precursor animal was a segmented bilaterian (triploblastic coelomate) [9]. If we are to accept that the blood vascular system evolved as a means to bypass the bulkheads of a segmented animal (see next section), then the first such system likely arose during this time. Flow would have been mediated by peristaltic vessels, perhaps like those described in the annelid. Blood probably percolated through spaces in the extracellular matrix, and thus, the system was by definition closed, albeit primitive. This scenario supports homology of all blood vascular systems."

In particular, both cell types possess a specialized filtration diaphragm, known as the slit diaphragm in podocytes or the nephrocyte diaphragm in nephrocytes. We find that fly (Drosophila melanogaster) orthologues of the major constituents of the slit diaphragm, including nephrin, NEPH1 (also known as KIRREL), CD2AP, ZO-1 (TJP1) and podocin, are expressed in the nephrocyte and form a complex of interacting proteins that closely mirrors the vertebrate slit diaphragm complex. Furthermore, we find that the nephrocyte diaphragm is completely lost in flies lacking the orthologues of nephrin or NEPH1 - a phenotype resembling loss of the slit diaphragm in the absence of either nephrin (as in human congenital nephrotic syndrome of the Finnish type, NPHS1) or NEPH1. These changes markedly impair filtration function in the nephrocyte.

Henle's loop permitted the generation of an osmolar gradient for water reabsorption in the collecting duct and enabled the concentratation of urine, which contributed to the successful establishment of mammalian life.(16) (...) Avian and mammalian kidneys show a major modification to the basic structure of the nephron-Henle's loop-which enabled urine to be concentrated. Bird kidneys contain two types of nephrons: nephrons with Henle's loop ('mammalian type') and nephrons without Henle's loop ('reptilian type'). By contrast, all nephrons in mammals display Henle's loop, although the lengths of these loops differ both within and between species."

Despite the absence of an intromittent phallus in adult tuataras, our observations show that tuatara embryos develop genital anlagen. This illustrates that there is a conserved developmental stage of external genital development among all amniotes and suggests a single evolutionary origin of amniote external genitalia."

(...) There is, however, variation amongst the vertebrates in how germ cell development and maturation is accomplished. This difference can be broadly divided into two distinct patterns, one present in anamniotes (fish, amphibia) and the other in amniotes (reptiles, birds, mammals). For anamniotes, spermatogenesis occurs in spermatocysts (cysts) which for most species develop within seminiferous lobules. Cysts are produced when a Sertoli cell becomes associated with a primary spermatogonium. Mitotic divisions of the primary spermatogonium produce a cohort of secondary spermatogonia that are enclosed by the Sertoli cell which forms the wall of the cyst. With spermatogenic progression a clone of isogeneic spermatozoa is produced which are released, by rupture of the cyst, into the lumen of the seminiferous lobule. Following spermiation, the Sertoli cell degenerates. For anamniotes, therefore, there is no permanent germinal epithelium since spermatocysts have to be replaced during successive breeding seasons. By contrast, spermatogenesis in amniotes does not occur in cysts but in seminiferous tubules that possess a permanent population of Sertoli cells and spermatogonia which act as a germ cell reservoir for succeeding bouts of spermatogenic activity. There is, in general, a greater variation in the organization of the testis and pattern of spermatogenesis in the anamniotes compared to amniotes."

The term is applied here to the somatic cell of the germinal compartment, regardless of species or stage of development. Sertoli cells share a common origin with cells destined to form the collecting duct system of the testis and begin their association with germ cells early in spermatogenesis, even before definitive clone formation.

However, the evolutionary history of vertebrate gills has been the subject of a long-standing controversy [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. It is thought that gills evolved independently in cyclostomes (jawless vertebrates-lampreys and hagfish) and gnathostomes (jawed vertebrates-cartilaginous and bony fishes), based on their distinct embryonic origins: the gills of cyclostomes derive from endoderm [9, 10, 11, 12], while gnathostome gills were classically thought to derive from ectoderm [10, 13]. Here, we demonstrate by cell lineage tracing that the gills of a cartilaginous fish, the little skate (Leucoraja erinacea), are in fact endodermally derived. This finding supports the homology of gills in cyclostomes and gnathostomes, and a single origin of pharyngeal gills prior to the divergence of these two ancient vertebrate lineages."

It is therefore reasonable to suggest that the parathyroid gland evolved as a result of the transformation of the gills into the parathyroid glands of tetrapods and the transition from an aquatic to a terrestrial environment. This interpretation would also explain the positioning of the parathyroid gland within the pharynx in the tetrapod body. Were the parathyroid gland to have emerged de novo with the evolution of the tetrapods it could, as an endocrine organ, have been placed anywhere in the body and still exert its effect."

But the parietal bone seems to illustrate just such a case. In the mouse it originates from cephalic paraxial mesoderm (Jiang et al., 2000; Morriss-Kay, 2001), whereas in chicken the parietal bone has been traced back to either mesodermal (Noden, 1978) or, according to improved methodological approach, to neural crest cells (Couly et al., 1992, 1993) (fig. 1). In the clawed frog (Xenopus laevis), the only other animal for which the embryonic origin of a membrane bone is currently known (Gross and Hanken, 2005), a single fronto-parietal bone also originates from neural crest cells, although a contribution from cranial paraxial mesodermal cells cannot be excluded, as these have not yet been fate-mapped. These differences suggest that either the pattern of neural crest contribution to the vertebrate skull has changed significantly during evolution, or that widely accepted skull bone homologies across major clades may be incorrect (Hanken and Gross, 2005)."

Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction/Southern blotting revealed that both amphioxus TTF-1 and TPO genes are expressed mainly in the adult endostyle. Spatial and temporal expression patterns assessed by in situ hybridization revealed that BbTTF-1 is expressed in the endodermal cells during early embryogenesis and is maintained in all zones of the adult endostyle. On the other hand, expression of BbTPO is chiefly in zones 5 and 6 of the adult endostyle where it overlaps with that of BbTTF-1, and to a lesser extent in zones 1 and 3. This restriction of the expression of BbTTF-1 and BbTPO to the endostyle strongly suggests that the endostyle is homologous to the follicle of the thyroid gland. Moreover, the spatial and temporal expression patterns of these genes suggest that TTF-1 regulates TPO expression.

The intention is to use evidence of the development of the five primary podia, which are core structures of the echinoderm body plan, to explore whether variation in the development of the primary podia between the echinoderm classes assists in identifying homologous structures in the other phyla....Extending the idea of a conserved regional specialization of the inner archenteron to other deuterostome phyla gives a source for the homology between the deuterostome phyla, leading to inferences of homologous structures."
