2015-04-14: 
- update annotations, notably to add single-entity annotations corresponding to the "split" of multiple-entities annotations
- fix bugs in annotation inference based on logical constraints

2015-04-13: 
- update annotations
- annotations are now provided in 3 files: raw annotations, summary annotations, and homology ancestral taxa annotations
- some annotations are now automatically inferred, using transformation_of relations, and logical contraints, from the Uberon ontology

2015-02-04:
- release updated annotations. Notably, many negative annotations have been removed: the similarity annotations capture similarity relations, not common ancestral taxa in case of homology; as a result, it is, e.g., not a conflict to state that a structure exhibits evidence of homology among both vertebrata and chordata; it is a conflict to state that a structure exhibits evidence of homology among chordata on the one hand, and to state that the common ancestral taxon for this structure is vertebrata (no homology should be present at the chordata level then).
- IDs of terms from the Confidence Information Ontology have been updated to follow its new ID prefix policy ('CONF:' prefixes have been replaced by 'CIO:' prefixes)
