PNAS (2002)	We have collected a set of 347 proteins that are found in eukaryotic cells but have no significant homology to proteins in Archaea and Bacteria. We call these proteins eukaryotic signature proteins (ESPs). The dominant hypothesis for the formation of the eukaryotic cell is that it is a fusion of an archaeon with a bacterium. If this hypothesis is accepted then the three cellular domains, Eukarya, Archaea, and Bacteria, would collapse into two cellular domains. We have used the existence of this set of ESPs to test this hypothesis. The evidence of the ESPs implicates a third cell (chronocyte) in the formation of the eukaryotic cell. [...] The eukaryotic cell is not a simple fusion of an archaeon and bacterium. This statement is borne out by the existence of 347 ESPs. [...] We agree with Horiike et al. that the nucleus is an endosymbiont with inputs from Bacteria and Archaea. We disagree that the host cell came from the Bacteria. The host cell or chronocyte was not a prokaryotic cell but one that had a cytoskeleton composed of actin and tubulin and an extensive membrane system.	bgee	ANN	2013-06-21

Microscopy Research and Technique (2010)	Spermatogenesis appears to be a fairly conserved process throughout the vertebrate series. (...) There is, however, variation amongst the vertebrates in how germ cell development and maturation is accomplished. This difference can be broadly divided into two distinct patterns, one present in anamniotes (fish, amphibia) and the other in amniotes (reptiles, birds, mammals). For anamniotes, spermatogenesis occurs in spermatocysts (cysts) which for most species develop within seminiferous lobules. Cysts are produced when a Sertoli cell becomes associated with a primary spermatogonium. Mitotic divisions of the primary spermatogonium produce a cohort of secondary spermatogonia that are enclosed by the Sertoli cell which forms the wall of the cyst. With spermatogenic progression a clone of isogeneic spermatozoa is produced which are released, by rupture of the cyst, into the lumen of the seminiferous lobule. Following spermiation, the Sertoli cell degenerates. For anamniotes, therefore, there is no permanent germinal epithelium since spermatocysts have to be replaced during successive breeding seasons. By contrast, spermatogenesis in amniotes does not occur in cysts but in seminiferous tubules that possess a permanent population of Sertoli cells and spermatogonia which act as a germ cell reservoir for succeeding bouts of spermatogenic activity. There is, in general, a greater variation in the organization of the testis and pattern of spermatogenesis in the anamniotes compared to amniotes.	bgee	ANN	2013-08-30

Animal Biology (2006)	It would, for example, be considered strange if a bone of mesodermal origin in one vertebrate is a direct homologue of a bone of neural crest origin in another species. But the parietal bone seems to illustrate just such a case. In the mouse it originates from cephalic paraxial mesoderm (Jiang et al., 2000; Morriss-Kay, 2001), whereas in chicken the parietal bone has been traced back to either mesodermal (Noden, 1978) or, according to improved methodological approach, to neural crest cells (Couly et al., 1992, 1993) (fig. 1). In the clawed frog (Xenopus laevis), the only other animal for which the embryonic origin of a membrane bone is currently known (Gross and Hanken, 2005), a single fronto-parietal bone also originates from neural crest cells, although a contribution from cranial paraxial mesodermal cells cannot be excluded, as these have not yet been fate-mapped. These differences suggest that either the pattern of neural crest contribution to the vertebrate skull has changed significantly during evolution, or that widely accepted skull bone homologies across major clades may be incorrect (Hanken and Gross, 2005).	bgee	ANN	2013-09-05

While segmentation has been proposed to be a feature of the common ancestor of vertebrates and arthropods, considering vertebrates and Drosophila alone, it is impossible to conclude whether the ancestral primary segmented tissue was the ectoderm or the mesoderm.	bgee	ANN	2013-07-10

The definition can be unambiguous, since 'cortex' simply implies the existence of a surface neuronal layer with an overlying 'zonal lamina' or 'molecular' layer containing dendrites and axons, which is separated from the underlying basal 'matrix' by white matter. Although reptilian cerebral cortex does indeed fulfill these conditions in certain locations, the separation from striatal structures is often indistinct, so that it may even be argued that some primitive dipnoans possess a pallium or cortex. Nevertheless, an extensive laminated layer separated by underlying white matter is well represented only in reptiles and mammals.	bgee	ANN	2013-06-11

Very early in their history fishes developed supplementary air-breathing organs, at least independently in two different taxonomic lines, from which the Actinopterygians with the bony fishes and the Sarcopterygians with the lung fishes survived.	bgee	ANN	2013-09-06

Terrestrialization, especially, requires fundamental changes of the respiratory system, as can be witnessed in molluscs, arthropods, and craniotes.	bgee	ANN	2013-09-06

J Thromb Haemost (2013)	The blood vascular system consists of blood-filled spaces (vessels, sinuses, hemocoels, and/or pumping organs) within the connective tissue compartment, which is continuous around and between all tissue layers in the body [6]. In invertebrates, the spaces are lined only by matrix. Vertebrates have evolved a secondary cell lining, termed endothelium. (...)The last common ancestor of vertebrates and annelids, or of vertebrates and mollusks was the ancestor of the protostome–deuterostome ancestor, which lived between 600 and 700 million years ago [59]. Although the fossil record is scarce, it is widely believed that this precursor animal was a segmented bilaterian (triploblastic coelomate) [9]. If we are to accept that the blood vascular system evolved as a means to bypass the bulkheads of a segmented animal (see next section), then the first such system likely arose during this time. Flow would have been mediated by peristaltic vessels, perhaps like those described in the annelid. Blood probably percolated through spaces in the extracellular matrix, and thus, the system was by definition closed, albeit primitive. This scenario supports homology of all blood vascular systems.	bgee	ANN	2013-07-18

These domains match corresponding domains in the vertebrate neural tube and give rise to conserved neural cell types. As in vertebrates, neural patterning genes are sensitive to Bmp signaling.

In mammals, the separation between the two pleural cavities and the peritoneal cavity develops by the pleuroperitoneal membranes, which push in from the dorsolateral body wall, and by other folds that extend laterally from the mesenteries and medially from the body wall to meet the pleuroperitoneal membranes.	bgee	ANN	2013-09-24

(...) These basic relationships have not been modified by urodeles. (...) In their partitioning of their coelom, embryonic mammals resemble first early fishes (incomplete partition, posterior to heart, consisting of the transverse septum) and then reptiles (pericardium derived from transverse septum and pleuropericardial membranes). Mammals then separate paired pleural cavities from the peritoneal cavity by a diaphragm. The ventral portion of this organ comes from the transverse septum. The dorsal portion is derived from the dorsal mesentery and from still another pair of outgrowths from the lateral body wall, the pleuroperitoneal membranes.	bgee	ANN	2013-09-24

Compared to the more primitive protochordates (e.g. amphioxus), this represents a stage where all previously scattered insulin-producing cells of the intestinal tissue have now quantitatively migrated to found a new organ involved in sensing blood glucose rather than gut glucose.

J Morphol (2004)	The original vertebrate kidney, archinephros or holonephros, is believed to have covered the entire length of the coelom, consisting of paired segmental tubules with associated glomeruli, archinephrons (Price, 1897; Goodrich, 1958). Each tubule opened into the coelom through a ciliated nephrostome and was connected to the archinephric duct, which led to the exterior (Goodrich, 1958). Nephrons were present at some time in all body segments, but later were restricted to the trunk region of the animal. A tendency for the most anterior tubules to develop and function in early life, and for the more posterior tubules to develop and function later in life led to the differentiation into pro-, meso-, and metanephros (Goodrich, 1958).	bgee	ANN	2013-08-29

Henle's loop permitted the generation of an osmolar gradient for water reabsorption in the collecting duct and enabled the concentratation of urine, which contributed to the successful establishment of mammalian life.(16) (...) Avian and mammalian kidneys show a major modification to the basic structure of the nephron—Henle's loop—which enabled urine to be concentrated. Bird kidneys contain two types of nephrons: nephrons with Henle's loop ('mammalian type') and nephrons without Henle's loop ('reptilian type'). By contrast, all nephrons in mammals display Henle's loop, although the lengths of these loops differ both within and between species.	bgee	ANN	2013-08-29

Nat Commun (2013)	The vertebrate mineralized skeleton is known to have first emerged as an exoskeleton that extensively covered the fossil jawless fish. The evolutionary origin of this exoskeleton has long been attributed to the emergence of the neural crest, but experimental evaluation for this is still poor. Here we determine the embryonic origin of scales and fin rays of medaka (teleost trunk exoskeletons) by applying long-term cell labelling methods, and demonstrate that both tissues are mesodermal in origin. Neural crest cells, however, fail to contribute to these tissues. This result suggests that the trunk neural crest has no skeletogenic capability in fish, instead highlighting the dominant role of the mesoderm in the evolution of the trunk skeleton. This further implies that the role of the neural crest in skeletogenesis has been predominant in the cephalic region from the early stage of vertebrate evolution.	bgee	ANN	2013-08-12

The lamprey's camera-like eye has a lens, an iris and extra-ocular muscles (five of them, unlike the eyes of jawed vertebrates, which have six), although it lacks intra-ocular muscles. Its retina also has a structure very similar to that of the retinas of other vertebrates, with three nuclear layers comprised of the cell bodies of photoreceptors and bipolar, horizontal, amacrine and ganglion cells.

Caryologia (2006)	In reptilian skin, a novel, successful type of multicellular glands appears that shares several morpho-functional traits with mammalian sebaceous and avian preen glands (Quay 1986a). In this review, they are therefore referred to a common lipogenic class. These glands are exclusive of Amniota and perform similar functions to the syncytial lipid glands in phyllomedusine tree frogs, by providing a hydrophobic shield against terrestrial environs. They differ from the latter in that they are epithelial rather than syncytial in structure, undergo holocrine degeneration during lipogenesis and lack a myoepithelial sheath. Besides waterproofing the body surface and horny skin appendages (feathers and hairs), sebaceous units may play an accessory role as scent (odorous) glands, either as homogeneous secretory organs, or in association with apocrine sweat tubules (in mammals).	bgee	ANN	2013-10-10

Current Opinion in Neurobiology (1998)	Because achieving high sensitivity is generally advantageous for auditory organs, it is not surprising that evidence for cochlear amplification is also seen in nonmammals. Spontaneous otoacoustic emissions (SOAEs) are narrow-band sound signals emitted from the inner ear, and it is generally assumed that their energy derives from the hair-cell molecular motors underlying cochlear amplification. However, all terrestrial vertebrates studied so far (including amphibians) show very similar SOAEs. The most parsimonious explanation for the universality of this phenomena is that some kind of amplifying mechanism is at least as old as land vertebrates themselves.	bgee	ANN	2013-06-25

Bioessays (2003)	Hiccoughs are characterized by glottal closure during neuronal inspiration, and by early development in relation to lung ventilation. They are inhibited during hypercapnia and by lung inflation. They can be abolished by baclofen. These properties are shared by ventilatory motor patterns of lower vertebrates, leading to the hypothesis that hiccough is the resurgence of archaic motor patterns and particularly of the motor pattern of gill ventilation in bimodal breathers such as most frogs, at the tadpole stage. A circuit that can generate hiccoughs may persist in mammals because it has permitted the development of pattern generators for other useful functions such as modern eupnea or suckling. Neurone recordings may permit testing of these models by comparing the pattern of neuronal activation during hiccoughs in mammals and during gill ventilation in bimodal breathers.	bgee	ANN	2013-06-12

Development (1996)	In craniate embryos, neural expression of Distal-less-related genes is exclusively in the forebrain (...). Because the major neural expression domain of amphioxus AmphiDll is in the anterior three-fourths of the cerebral vesicle, we suggest that this region of the neural tube is homologous to parts of the craniate forebrain. This conclusion is strongly supported by three-dimensional, computer-assisted reconstruction of the neural tube of amphioxus based on serial transmission electron microscopy. At the neuroanatomical level, a number of detailed homologies are indicated between the anterior three-fourths of the amphioxus cerebral vesicle and the diencephalic region of the craniate forebrain. If one assumes that the amphioxus condition fairly represents the nervous system of the proximate ancestor of the craniates, one can suggest that they evolved from a creature that had the beginnings of a forebrain.	bgee	ANN	2013-06-11

It is noteworthy that the latter structures require specific expression of Pax6 in the rhombic lip of the gnathostome hindbrain. Interestingly, the lamprey rhombic lip does not express Pax6. Thus, it is tempting to speculate that in vertebrate evolution the rostral hindbrain is incapable of differentiating into the cerebellum before the co-option of Pax6 in that region. In other words, cerebellum has been brought about as an evolutionary innovation in gnathostomes, based on exaptation of MHB, rhombic lip, and some regulatory gene expression already present in the vertebrate common ancestor.	bgee	ANN	2013-06-11

Nature (2009)	loss of Tbx5 in the mouse ventricle results in a single chamber lacking distinct identity, indicating a requirement for Tbx5 in septation. Importantly, misexpression of Tbx5 throughout the developing myocardium to mimic the reptilian expression pattern also results in a single mispatterned ventricular chamber lacking septation. Thus ventricular septation is established by a steep and correctly positioned Tbx5 gradient. Our findings provide a molecular mechanism for the evolution of the amniote ventricle, and support the concept that altered expression of developmental regulators is a key mechanism of vertebrate evolution.	bgee	ANN	2013-07-19

It consists of sensory neurons that express evolutionary unrelated groups of transmembrane chemoreceptors. The predominant V1R and V2R receptor repertoires are believed to detect airborne and water-soluble molecules, respectively.It has been suggested that the shift in habitat of early tetrapods from water to land is reflected by an increase in the ratio of V1R/V2R genes.

Our results do not support the hypothesis that the shift to a vomeronasal receptor repertoire dominated by V1Rs in mammals reflects the evolutionary transition of early tetrapods from water to land.

Ciona intestinalis as a model for cardiac development. Semin Cell Dev Biol (2007)	In early juveniles [of tunicate Ciona intestinalis], the heart rudiment consists of a seemingly unstructured mass of cells (B. D. unpublished observations). In diagrams made from sectioned juveniles, researchers have described the formation of two distinct hollow tubes that fuse into a single tube [25]. An invagination along the dorsal surface of this tube gives rise to the myocardium while the outer surface differentiates as pericardium. Further studies are required to confirm these classic observations of post-larval cardiogenesis. If these observations prove accurate, they indicate that Ciona heart morphogenesis may exhibit some ancestral chordate characteristics. In Xenopus and the basal chordate amphioxus, the myocardium is also derived from a dorsal invagination [26, 27]. Whether this process is actually homologous among the chordates must await more detailed molecular characterizations.	bgee	ANN	2013-07-19

Experimental Biology Online (1999)	In green iguanas, as in most lepidosaurs, the body cavity is not divided into separate pleural and peritoneal spaces. Instead, the lungs and viscera are contained within a single,„pleuroperitoneal“ cavity. This condition is also seen in air-breathing fishes and amphibians, indicating that an undivided body cavity is the primitive condition for amniotes.	bgee

The prevertebrate chordates do not have a true stomach, whereas the cartilaginous and bony fish do. Although most fish do have a true stomach, some fish species appear to have lost the stomach secondarily. The remaining vertebrate lineages do have a true stomach (at least in the adult animal), although there is great variation in the size and shape of the stomach.	bgee

(…) All amniotes contain the following four extraembryonic components: the amnion, chorion, yolk sac, and allantois (Fig. 1C). Like the intraembryonic tissues, these extraembryonic tissues are composed of cells representing the three germ layers: ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm.(...) A comparative knowledge of these extraembryonic tissues and their role in nutrient uptake during development is required to fully appreciate the adaptive changes in placental mammals.

(...) These basic relationships have not been modified by urodeles. The small pericardial cavity remains far forward where it is separated by a transverse septum from the principal coelom, which may now be called a pleuroperitoneal cavity because slender lungs are present. (...) The heart (of other tetrapods) is separated from the lungs (and liver if present) by more or less horizontal partitions that have their origin in the embryo as folds on the serous membrane of the right and left lateral body walls. These grow out to join in the midline of the body. They are called lateral mesocardia (birds) or pleuropericardial membranes. Posteriorly they join the transverse septum to form the adult pericardial membrane, or pericardium. (...) In their partitioning of their coelom, embryonic mammals resemble first early fishes (incomplete partition, posterior to heart, consisting of the transverse septum) and then reptiles (pericardium derived from transverse septum and pleuropericardial membranes). Mammals then separate paired pleural cavities from the peritoneal cavity by a diaphragm. The ventral portion of this organ comes from the transverse septum. The dorsal portion is derived from the dorsal mesentery and from still another pair of outgrowths from the lateral body wall, the pleuroperitoneal membranes.	bgee	ANN	2013-07-16

Nat Commun (2013)	The vertebrate mineralized skeleton is known to have first emerged as an exoskeleton that extensively covered the fossil jawless fish. The evolutionary origin of this exoskeleton has long been attributed to the emergence of the neural crest, but experimental evaluation for this is still poor. Here we determine the embryonic origin of scales and fin rays of medaka (teleost trunk exoskeletons) by applying long-term cell labelling methods, and demonstrate that both tissues are mesodermal in origin. Neural crest cells, however, fail to contribute to these tissues. This result suggests that the trunk neural crest has no skeletogenic capability in fish, instead highlighting the dominant role of the mesoderm in the evolution of the trunk skeleton. This further implies that the role of the neural crest in skeletogenesis has been predominant in the cephalic region from the early stage of vertebrate evolution.	bgee	ANN	2013-08-12

Nephrostomes and comparatively large glomeruli are present in the hagfish pronephros (Table 1) (...) the hypothetical ‘stem-kidney’ was developed from a series of nephric tubules opening into the coelom (or into a nephric chamber in a more evolved state), each with a ciliated nephrostome, vis-à-vis to a glomerulus. These tubules would laterally join a common duct that runs caudally to open near the anus (cf. Fig. 1A). This model is strongly modified in all extant vertebrates. However, in males that have a urogenital connection, the nephrons that later participate in seminal transport outline this pattern during differentiation.	bgee	ANN	2013-08-28

Ancestral craniates probably had an external glomerulus and nephrostomes, as do the first few to develop in very primitive craniates. (...) The mechanism would become more efficient as the coelomic recess into which each glomerulus discharged became a part of the tubule, that is, grew around the glomerulus as a renal capsule.

Dev Biol (2010)	The ascidian mouth opening is derived from the anterior neuropore (...) The relative positions of the brain and mouth are of central importance for models of chordate evolution. The dorsal hollow neural tube and the mouth have often been thought of as developmentally distinct structures that may have followed independent evolutionary paths. In most chordates however, including vertebrates and ascidians, the mouth primordia have been shown to fate to the anterior neural boundary. In ascidians such as Ciona there is a particularly intimate relationship between brain and mouth development, with a thin canal connecting the neural tube lumen to the mouth primordium at larval stages. This so-called neurohypophyseal canal was previously thought to be a secondary connection that formed relatively late, after the independent formation of the mouth primordium and the neural tube.

Early in evolution, before the optic cup invaginated, the axons from retinal ganglion cells would simply have run over the surface of the structure. Hence, one can view the optic nerve as having acted rather like a rope in linking the retina to higher centres: the developing eye cup has simply wrapped around this 'rope', and the developing axons have thereby not needed to penetrate the retina.	bgee	ANN	2013-06-21

The zebrafish AER [apical ectodermal ridge] is an apical ectodermal thickening at the distal tip of the fin bud and consists of wedge-shaped cells of the basal stratum. The AER is observed only transiently, and from 36 hpf onwards the cells of this region form the apical fold (AF), which consists of a dorsal and a ventral layer of cylindrically-shaped ectodermal cells extending from the anterior to the posterior fin margin. Despite the change in shape, the AF still carries out the same functions as the AER. Indeed, although the AER receives its name from its characteristic shape, being composed of a pseudostratified ectoderm in the chicken and a polystratified ectoderm in the mouse, this independence of AER morphology from its function is also observed in tetrapods. The AF also expresses similar molecular markers to the tetrapod AER, suggesting that it fulfills similar functions in the fin as the AER does in tetrapod limbs.	bgee	ANN	2013-07-16

The zebrafish AER [apical ectodermal ridge] is an apical ectodermal thickening at the distal tip of the fin bud and consists of wedge-shaped cells of the basal stratum. The AER is observed only transiently, and from 36 hpf onwards the cells of this region form the apical fold (AF), which consists of a dorsal and a ventral layer of cylindrically-shaped ectodermal cells extending from the anterior to the posterior fin margin. Despite the change in shape, the AF still carries out the same functions as the AER. Indeed, although the AER receives its name from its characteristic shape, being composed of a pseudostratified ectoderm in the chicken and a polystratified ectoderm in the mouse, this independence of AER morphology from its function is also observed in tetrapods. The AF also expresses similar molecular markers to the tetrapod AER, suggesting that it fulfills similar functions in the fin as the AER does in tetrapod limbs.	bgee	ANN	2013-07-16

Each tubule opened into the coelom through a ciliated nephrostome and was connected to the archinephric duct, which led to the exterior (Goodrich, 1958). Nephrons were present at some time in all body segments, but later were restricted to the trunk region of the animal.

Ciona intestinalis as a model for cardiac development. Semin Cell Dev Biol (2007)	In older juveniles (approximately 2 weeks after metamorphosis) the Ciona heart tube begins to fold into its characteristic V-shape (BD, personal observations). This shape change may be caused by the growth of the heart tube in length while the two ends remain at a relatively fixed distance [28]. It is possible that the bending is also influenced by the spiral orientation of the cardiac myofibers. Whether this event bears any homology to cardiac looping in vertebrates remains purely speculative. A detailed characterization of the mechanistic and genetic basis for heart bending in Ciona is required to resolve this issue.	bgee	ANN	2013-07-18

The coelom of these animals thus consists of four compartments: the pericardial cavity, two pleural cavities, and the peritoneal cavity. [...] In reptiles and birds, the folds separating the pleural cavities from the peritoneal cavity form the oblique septum. In mammals, the separation between the two pleural cavities and the peritoneal cavity develops by the pleuroperitoneal membranes, which push in from the dorsolateral body wall, and by other folds that extend laterally from the mesenteries and medially from the body wall to meet the pleuroperitoneal membranes.	bgee	ANN	2013-09-24

The small pericardial cavity remains far forward where it is separated by a transverse septum from the principal coelom, which may now be called a pleuroperitoneal cavity because slender lungs are present. (...) In their partitioning of their coelom, embryonic mammals resemble first early fishes (incomplete partition, posterior to heart, consisting of the transverse septum) and then reptiles (pericardium derived from transverse septum and pleuropericardial membranes). Mammals then separate paired pleural cavities from the peritoneal cavity by a diaphragm. The ventral portion of this organ comes from the transverse septum. The dorsal portion is derived from the dorsal mesentery and from still another pair of outgrowths from the lateral body wall, the pleuroperitoneal membranes.	bgee	ANN	2013-09-24

Dev Biol (2010)	The relative positions of the brain and mouth are of central importance for models of chordate evolution. The dorsal hollow neural tube and the mouth have often been thought of as developmentally distinct structures that may have followed independent evolutionary paths. In most chordates however, including vertebrates and ascidians, the mouth primordia have been shown to fate to the anterior neural boundary. In ascidians such as Ciona there is a particularly intimate relationship between brain and mouth development, with a thin canal connecting the neural tube lumen to the mouth primordium at larval stages. This so-called neurohypophyseal canal was previously thought to be a secondary connection that formed relatively late, after the independent formation of the mouth primordium and the neural tube. Here we show that the Ciona neurohypophyseal canal is present from the end of neurulation and represents the anteriormost neural tube, and that the future mouth opening is actually derived from the anterior neuropore.	bgee	ANN	2013-09-24
